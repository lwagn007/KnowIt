                            KnowIt is broken down into five usable sections. First you must create a physician within the Physician page, then follow suit with Procedure, Equipment, and Medication. It is a little work at the beginning, but the magic occurs at the Physician Preference page where you can store Physician preferences for procedures with what medications and equipment you will need.
